            <p>Candelas is a Mexican-American artist, singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist based in Las Vegas, Nevada. Blending alternative rock, indie, and pop influences, his music captures raw emotion through vivid storytelling and a deep connection to identity and place.</p>
            <p>American born and raised between cultures, he began writing songs in 2004, developing a passion for crafting music that feels both personal and universal. A self-taught instrumentalist with classical vocal training, he embodies the independent spirit, writing, recording, mixing, and producing his own music from start to finish. His DIY approach gives each track an honest, handmade quality that reflects his commitment to authenticity.</p>
            <p>Before launching his solo work, Candelas fronted the rock band Blood Roosters in Aguascalientes, MX earning local recognition for their high-energy performances and original sound. After relocating to Las Vegas, he founded SECOS, an alternative rock group that performed at major events such as Life Is Beautiful Festival, Jam in the Van, and opened for national touring acts including Dogstar at the Brooklyn Bowl.</p>
            <p>Beyond his own music, Candelas is the founder of Pineapple Fest, a Las Vegas-based event celebrating live bands, community, and the spirit of independent music. His dedication to the local scene and hands-on creative process reflect a deep love for collaboration and artistic growth.</p>
            <p>Today, Candelas's solo work continues to evolve, rooted in introspection, cultural pride, and the energy of live performance. Joined by a talented live band, he brings his songs to life on stage with a blend of power, emotion, and connection that resonates wherever he performs.</p>
            <p>From Aguascalientes to Las Vegas, Candelas represents the voice of a new generation of independent artists, bridging cultures and sounds through passion, perseverance, and the universal language of rock.</p>
